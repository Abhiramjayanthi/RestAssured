Framework should be GENERIC not SPECIFIC
Framework should be shareable , reusable and extendable over period of time

We can write RestAssured code in the below way as well
public void newDeckOfCards(){
        RequestSpecification requestSec=RestAssured.given();  //This class has all the methods that are required for preparing the request.
                Response response= requestSec.get("https://www.deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/new/");
        ValidatableResponse validate= response.then();
    }
